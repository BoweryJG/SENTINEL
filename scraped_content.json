At Living Care Home Services, we know how important this decision is. We‚Äôre not just a service provider‚Äîwe‚Äôre your partner in care. For over two decades, we‚Äôve remained committed to supporting families with genuine compassion, flexibility, and respect.\n\nBelow, we‚Äôve outlined 15 meaningful reasons why our home health care company continues to be the preferred choice for families throughout Doylestown and the surrounding areas:\n\n1. We‚Äôre Family-Owned and Community-Based\n\nWe‚Äôre not a franchise‚Äîwe‚Äôre a locally owned home health care business serving Doylestown and nearby communities. Our decisions are driven by care, not by corporate quotas or out-of-state policies. This allows us to respond quickly, personally, and flexibly to every family‚Äôs unique needs.\n\n2. We Match Caregivers Thoughtfully\n\nWe don‚Äôt just assign caregivers‚Äîwe handpick them based on personality, experience, and compatibility with your loved one. That extra step creates comfort, trust, and continuity. Many of our caregivers build long-term relationships with the families they serve.\n\n3. Licensed Professionals With Real-World Experience\n\nOur team includes licensed nurses and caregivers who bring decades of healthcare knowledge into every home. They‚Äôre trained to notice subtle changes in health and behavior that others might overlook. This experience helps prevent complications and ensures safe, effective care.\n\n4.

Care That‚Äôs Based on Listening, Not Assumptions\n\nWe begin every relationship with an open conversation‚Äînot a checklist. Your family‚Äôs values, goals, and preferences shape the care we provide. This leads to more respectful, thoughtful support that truly aligns with your expectations.\n\n9.

    "content": "Meet the Team\n\nHome\nMeet the Team\nYour Trusted Home Health Care Partner in Doylestown, PA\n\nPersonalized support from a team that puts family first.\n\nLiving Care Home Services has been serving your community since 2001. Sean Lynch, the founder of the company has been dedicated to providing compassionate, reliable in-home health care services‚Äîincluding live in caregiver support, home care services, private duty nursing, and occupational and physical therapy, with the purpose to enable clients to remain in the comfort of their own homes and be safe and well cared for by compassionate and skilled caregivers who share the common goal of making life as fulfilling and comforting for you as we would like for our own family members.\n\nOn May 1st, 2023, Doylestown natives, Daniel and Jennifer Townsley purchased Living Care Home services from Sean and share the same values that were instilled at the inception of the company 22 years ago. The Townsleys have over 30 years of healthcare business experience and Jennifer is a PA Licensed BSRN and has a B.S. in Psychology.\n\nDaniel and Jennifer are strong believers that any business, especially smaller businesses that are owned and operated by the community they serve have a responsibility to care for each other and support other local businesses that need to thrive for the success of the community. They believe that no matter what the business does, it should treat its clients how they would like to be treated. This especially applies to caring for your loved ones. This is an extremely important decision to make when it comes to providing care for your family and loved ones and they take this responsibility very seriously.\n\nLiving Care Home Services is a boutique company that has a bespoke approach to providing care. Not every client is the same and no two families are alike. They take the time to listen to each family individually and then match them with the caregiver that matches what they need. Whether it is for one hour or one year, they will make sure that your unique situation is taken very seriously and that the services are tailored to your specific needs. This is a unique approach to in-home health care that you lose when dealing with large chains that want to just fill a shift with someone who can work the hours. It‚Äôs not about how many clients we have, it‚Äôs about the level of care we provide that matters the most.\n\nOur Commitment to Families\nOur Mission\n\n‚ÄúWe Take the Worry Out of Caring for Someone You Love‚Äù\n\nThe most important point is‚Ä¶ that people receive the help they need. Whether it‚Äôs a special caregiver or shift, support, information or just a shoulder to lean on or an ear to listen to your concerns. Living Care Home Services is there to help.\n\nA Caring Family\n\nLiving Care Home Services is Family Owned and Family Oriented. We are not a franchise nor are we owned by a parent company in another state. This allows us the freedom to provide services in any location a family wishes us to go. We work for our clients and change what we do to meet your needs. We are not bound by decisions based on the bottom line. If we don‚Äôt have the right person to meet your needs, we will tell you so at the time of intake. Matching the correct caregiver to your individual needs is essential in creating a positive relationship from the beginning.\n\nOwners Daniel and Jennifer Townsley have over 30 years of experience in the healthcare field. This is what they do. Their understanding, caring, and compassion drive them to ensure the best quality of care for all our clients. We won‚Äôt send someone to your home who we wouldn‚Äôt send to our own.\nFamily values are especially important to our family of caregivers. All our caregivers are highly skilled, dedicated, and compassionate. They care for and about their clients.\n\nReferences\n\nWe wouldn‚Äôt entrust our family members with just anyone ‚Äî and we don‚Äôt expect you to either. We have many people whose families we have helped, who have offered to provide references for our services. Should you like to speak to any of them, we will be more than happy to provide you with their number at that time. We value all the families we work with and do not want to put their personal phone numbers on our website.\n\nGet in Touch\nMeet Your Local Home Health Care Company\nPresident / Owner\nDaniel Townsley\n\nLiving Care Home Services owners, Doylestown natives Daniel Townsley and his wife, Jennifer, are dedicated to providing compassionate and personalized in-home care.

This allows them to choose the BEST way to operate vs. being a single licensed facility which most in fact are. Our family of caregivers receive the highest level of training and support available. From the initial phone interview, the face to face interview with the Care Manager or the President, with on-going supervision right through to the exit interview, we strive to learn who our caregivers are as people. We believe that by treating and supporting our caregivers as family, they in turn treat the families they help as family.\n\nAll caregivers receive initial training and orientation and undergo an annual re-evaluation and must demonstrate competency as a caregiver as defined by the PA Department of Health guidelines. We ensure that your caregiver meets all requirements of our license including criminal history and background checks, professional reference checks, residency compliance, health and TB tests and have a valid Driver‚Äôs License and proper and current car insurance.

It is our belief that spending the time to ensure the correct caregiver match, before services begin, is essential in the successful outcome of services rendered. Loved ones are often reluctant to accept help so getting the right caregiver in place from the beginning is important.\n\nShould you ever be uncomfortable with the caregiver who works with you, you may ask to have a new caregiver at any time.

It is most important that you feel comfortable and at ease with your caregiver and that they feel the same about you. The bond you form will add comfort, safety and joy to the both of you in the relationship which will evolve.\n\nWe look at fulfilling each client and family‚Äôs needs, we understand that that need may change over time and that we must make changes in how we provide care to meet those needs.

In the past, these surgeries required people to be hospitalized and then receive physical therapy for long periods of time. No longer. People are being sent home the same day for many procedures, and are left to cope with the difficulties that go along with those discharges. Joint replacement surgery alone is increasing at an alarming rate.\n\nThe good news is that people are no longer being made to endure days of inpatient hospitalization or rehabilitation when better care can be received in their own home. Unfortunately, many families are sent home without the proper support or illness care. Many secondary illnesses or injuries often occur because someone is left alone when they should have outside help. Pain management in itself can be a big task for many on their own. The risk of falling while on pain medication increases greatly when there is no one to help.\n\nWe can be that help. We can provide competent caregivers who will assist families for short periods of time until they are able to care for themselves.

Personal Care services include those activities of daily living which are difficult for someone to complete on their own. These are the activities which require the assistance of another person in order for someone to live in their home setting. Activities such as bathing, dressing, medication reminders, meal prep, feeding, laundry, light housekeeping etc., are difficult or impossible for many people to complete on their own.\n\nOur caregivers are trained to assist families in assuring that these very vital tasks are performed on a regular basis and done so while maintaining the dignity and respect that all people deserve. Providing Personal Care for someone requires a caregiver who understands how sensitive people are, when it comes to asking for assistance with these tasks. At the same time, the caregiver must be able to convince someone of the necessity to bathe and complete all activities of daily living to reduce the possibility of developing secondary issues such as urinary tract infections, dehydration, anxiety, malnutrition etc., which complicates living at home.\n\nWe care very deeply for those we provide services for and respect their individual wishes. We also know that without assisting them in understanding that these services are necessary for their continued independence at home, they are more likely to be hospitalized or moved into a long term care setting.\n\nWe wouldn‚Äôt watch our own loved ones become ill or depressed and won‚Äôt watch that happen to yours either.

    "title": "FAQs",
    "content": "FAQs\n\nHome\nFAQs\nFAQs\n\nWhy should I choose Living Care Home Services?\n\nThere are lots of reasons to choose us! We use only the best caregivers who are available. We are family owned with family values who understand family needs. We show up, you can depend on us. We are totally dedicated to providing compassionate, reliable, and affordable care. We have experience, not just as professionally trained caregivers but as members of families who needed to provide care for our own families. We really care and we understand your unique situation because we have been there ourselves. ‚ÄúWe Take the Worry Out of Caring for Someone You Love.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between Living Care and other companies?\n\nLiving Care Home Services was started by Sean Lynch from his home in 2001. He was the first and only caregiver employed at the company for the first year. He worked day, middle and overnight shifts, personally escorted a client to Minnesota for a week to have a transplant check-up, worked with Hospice clients and was there holding their hand when they passed, and has worked with both male and female clients that first year. He has also had members of his own family receive home care services so understands the frustrations and the joy families can experience when getting outside help. This background helps meet client needs and better support the caregivers who are part of the household and those from our company.\n\nI need help now‚Ä¶can you help me?\n\nAbsolutely. We are committed to every hour of care a family may require. Our team is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We have a live answering service that can direct you to the right person to meet your needs after office hours. The service has been a part of our team for many years and understands your needs and will direct you accordingly. They will also listen to you, and make sure you get the help you need. We are committed to filling your needs within 24 hours or even the same day. We will do our best and we‚Äôll respect you and be honest with you if we can‚Äôt meet your requirements.\n\nDo you provide care to clients in assisted living or other types of facilities?\n\nYes. Our caregivers have provided care to family members in many local facilities such as assisted living, nursing homes, hospitals, etc. All facilities are required to obtain caregiver information such as certification and TB testing. All our caregivers are current with these requirements which enhance our ability to respond to requests within facilities. Most of the local facilities recognize our diligence in meeting their requirements and work well with us in meeting your needs in their facility.\n\nHow much does care cost?\n\nThe cost of obtaining care depends upon the type of care you require. We have very affordable HOURLY rates which vary depending on the amount of time we spend with you. The longer we are with you, the less expensive your hourly rate will be. The rates are the same for weekday, weekend, and overnight hours. We also provide 24-hour Live-in care with a DAILY rate associated with that level of care. To obtain specific costs, please get in touch with us.\n\nWhat if my situation changes and I need to change the service I receive?\n\nWe are flexible. We want to meet your needs and often those needs will change over time. We change with you. When you need a little more or a lot more help, we‚Äôll be there.

      "Why should I choose Living Care Home Services?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are lots of reasons to choose us!

      "What‚Äôs the difference between Living Care and other companies?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLiving Care Home Services was started by Sean Lynch from his home in 2001. He was the first and only caregiver employed at the company for the first year. He worked day, middle and overnight shifts, personally escorted a client to Minnesota for a week to have a transplant check-up, worked with Hospice clients and was there holding their hand when they passed, and has worked with both male and female clients that first year. He has also had members of his own family receive home care services so understands the frustrations and the joy families can experience when getting outside help. This background helps meet client needs and better support the caregivers who are part of the household and those from our company.",
      "I need help now‚Ä¶can you help me?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbsolutely. We are committed to every hour of care a family may require. Our team is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We have a live answering service that can direct you to the right person to meet your needs after office hours. The service has been a part of our team for many years and understands your needs and will direct you accordingly. They will also listen to you, and make sure you get the help you need. We are committed to filling your needs within 24 hours or even the same day. We will do our best and we‚Äôll respect you and be honest with you if we can‚Äôt meet your requirements.",
      "Do you provide care to clients in assisted living or other types of facilities?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes. Our caregivers have provided care to family members in many local facilities such as assisted living, nursing homes, hospitals, etc. All facilities are required to obtain caregiver information such as certification and TB testing. All our caregivers are current with these requirements which enhance our ability to respond to requests within facilities. Most of the local facilities recognize our diligence in meeting their requirements and work well with us in meeting your needs in their facility.",
      "How much does care cost?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe cost of obtaining care depends upon the type of care you require. We have very affordable HOURLY rates which vary depending on the amount of time we spend with you. The longer we are with you, the less expensive your hourly rate will be. The rates are the same for weekday, weekend, and overnight hours. We also provide 24-hour Live-in care with a DAILY rate associated with that level of care. To obtain specific costs, please get in touch with us.",
