- Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy
- 1. We’re Family-Owned and Community-Based
							
						
						
						
							We’re not a franchise—we’re a locally owned home health care business serving Doylestown and nearby communities. Our decisions are driven by care, not by corporate quotas or out-of-state policies. This allows us to respond quickly, personally, and flexibly to every family’s unique needs.
- 2. We Match Caregivers Thoughtfully
							
						
						
						
							We don’t just assign caregivers—we handpick them based on personality, experience, and compatibility with your loved one. That extra step creates comfort, trust, and continuity. Many of our caregivers build long-term relationships with the families they serve.
- 3. Licensed Professionals With Real-World Experience
							
						
						
						
							Our team includes licensed nurses and caregivers who bring decades of healthcare knowledge into every home. They’re trained to notice subtle changes in health and behavior that others might overlook. This experience helps prevent complications and ensures safe, effective care.
- 4. Care That Adapts as Needs Change
							
						
						
						
							We know that care plans must evolve as your loved one’s needs shift over time. Whether it’s progressing from hourly assistance to full-time care or adding medical support, we adjust with care and coordination. You’ll never be locked into a one-size-fits-all plan.
- 5. Privately Paid Services with Flexible Plans
							
						
						
						
							Our private-pay model puts your family in full control of care choices without waiting on insurance approvals. It means you can get the right help when you need it, without unnecessary delays or red tape. We offer flexible scheduling and billing to fit your preferences.
- 6. Live-In Care That Feels Like Family
							
						
						
						
							Our live-in caregiver services provide round-the-clock support in the comfort of home. These caregivers do more than assist with daily tasks—they become a trusted presence in your loved one’s life. This consistency supports both emotional well-being and physical safety.
- 7. Fast, Responsive Scheduling—Even Same Day
							
						
						
						
							We understand that care needs can change quickly, sometimes overnight. That’s why we’re available 24/7 and often arrange caregiver coverage within 24 hours. Our strong, reliable network allows us to respond to urgent needs with confidence and clarity.
- 8. Care That’s Based on Listening, Not Assumptions
							
						
						
						
							We begin every relationship with an open conversation—not a checklist. Your family’s values, goals, and preferences shape the care we provide. This leads to more respectful, thoughtful support that truly aligns with your expectations.
- 9. Hands-On Owners Who Stay Involved
							
						
						
						
							Daniel and Jennifer Townsley are more than names on a website—they’re directly involved in the daily operation of the business. They oversee intake, caregiver matching, and ongoing support for every client. Their hands-on leadership ensures accountability and a personal touch.
- 10. A Full Range of Home Health Care Options
							
						
						
						
							We offer a range of services including home health care services, private duty nursing, live-in caregiver support, and in-home occupational and physical therapy. You won’t have to juggle multiple providers for different care needs. Everything is coordinated through one dedicated team you can trust.
- 11. Genuine Relationships with Clients and Families
							
						
						
						
							We don’t just provide care—we build meaningful relationships. Many of our clients and caregivers grow close over time, creating a support system that extends beyond tasks and schedules. These relationships make every day more comfortable, familiar, and connected.
- 12. We Support Independence and Dignity
							
						
						
						
							Our goal is to help your loved one stay active, involved, and respected in their own home. We focus on what they can do—not just what they need help with. This empowers clients to maintain their independence while still receiving reliable support.
- 13. Specialized Care Options for Chronic Needs
							
						
						
						
							Families managing chronic conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer’s, or limited mobility need reliable, consistent help. Our private duty nursing services are designed to deliver that care in a calm, supportive home setting. With regular monitoring and specialized attention, we help reduce risks and maintain stability.
- 14. We Bring Therapy Services to Your Door
							
						
						
						
							Our in-home occupational and physical therapy services help improve strength, balance, and function—all without leaving home. This eliminates the stress of traveling to appointments, especially for those with mobility limitations. Therapists work directly with clients in their own environments, which supports safer and more lasting recovery.

- SERVICES & CARE
- 1. We Focus on Compatibility, Not Just Availability
							
						
						
						
							We don’t just place any available caregiver in your home—we carefully select someone who matches your loved one’s personality, needs, and lifestyle. This builds trust and comfort from day one. We believe care works best when it feels natural and familiar.
- 2. We’re Locally Owned and Personally Involved
							
						
						
						
							As a family-run business in Doylestown, we’re directly connected to the families we serve. Our owners stay involved in every step—from intake to caregiver selection—ensuring quality and consistency. You’re never dealing with a distant corporate office or impersonal system.
- 3. Live-In Care Means Around-the-Clock Support
							
						
						
						
							Our live-in caregivers provide consistent care day and night. From help with daily tasks to overnight reassurance, someone is always there. This consistency offers safety and stability for both clients and families.
- 4. We Help Your Loved One Stay at Home
							
						
						
						
							Moving to a facility can be disorienting and stressful, especially for seniors. With our live in caregiver services, your loved one can remain in their home, surrounded by their belongings, routines, and memories. Staying at home supports emotional well-being and independence.
- 5. We Prioritize Human Connection
							
						
						
						
							Our caregivers don’t just perform tasks—they build real relationships. From sharing meals to listening to stories, connection is a core part of the care experience. These bonds often become one of the most valued parts of the support we offer.
- 6. We’re Flexible With Family Schedules
							
						
						
						
							We understand that families have their own routines, responsibilities, and commitments. Our caregivers work with you to create a care plan that fits your schedule—not the other way around. Whether you need time away or ongoing support, we’re here.
- 7. We Value Dignity in Every Detail
							
						
						
						
							We know it’s not easy to accept help—especially with personal tasks. Our caregivers approach every aspect of care with respect, discretion, and kindness. Preserving dignity is a priority, not a bonus.
- 8. We’re Transparent About What We Can Provide
							
						
						
						
							If we’re not the right fit or don’t have the ideal caregiver available, we’ll tell you. We never make promises we can’t keep. Honesty and clarity are part of how we build trust with every family.
- 9. We Offer More Than Basic Help
							
						
						
						
							Our caregivers assist with daily routines like bathing, meals, and medication reminders, but their care goes deeper. They provide emotional support, gentle encouragement, and companionship that makes life feel fuller. We focus on the whole person—not just the tasks.
- 10. We Train and Support Our Caregivers Continuously
							
						
						
						
							Our caregivers receive ongoing guidance, feedback, and training to stay sharp and responsive to client needs. We check in regularly with both the caregiver and the family. This helps us maintain quality and address small issues before they grow.
- 11. We Respect Family Roles
							
						
						
						
							A live-in caregiver isn’t meant to replace family but to support and strengthen it. When we’re in the home, you can be a son or daughter again—not just a caregiver. This shift helps restore balance and emotional space for everyone involved.
- 12. Our Clients Often Stay With Us for Years
							
						
						
						
							Because we build care around the person—not a preset schedule—many families stay with us long-term. Some of our clients have had the same caregiver for years. That kind of continuity is rare—and it’s something we’re proud of.
- 14. We Keep Everyone in the Loop
							
						
						
						
							Communication is key to quality care. We keep families informed, respond promptly to concerns, and make sure everyone—client, caregiver, and family—is aligned. You’re never left guessing about your loved one’s care.
- 15. We Genuinely Care About What We Do
							
						
						
						
							This isn’t just a business to us—it’s a calling. Many of our caregivers have cared for their own family members and bring that same heart into their work. The result is care that’s not only reliable, but also full of warmth and intention.

- How We Deliver Meaningful Live In Support
- Let’s Talk About Live in Care That Truly Fits
- 1. We’re Built on Family Values
							
						
						
						
							As a family-owned business, our approach to care is rooted in empathy, trust, and respect. We don’t follow a corporate playbook—we follow what’s best for your family. That means care delivered with purpose, patience, and heart.

							Our hourly caregivers are trained, reliable, and responsive. Whether you need support during the day, at night, or even just a few times a week, we tailor our plan to your preferred routine. You stay in control of how and when care is delivered.
- 4. We Provide In-Home Comfort and Familiarity
							
						
						
						
							With our in-home hourly care, your loved one can remain in the place they know best. We help maintain daily habits, favorite surroundings, and comforting routines—all key to emotional and physical wellness. There’s no need to uproot them for quality support.
- 5. Cost-Effective, Scalable Care Plans
							
						
						
						
							We structure our pricing so that the longer we’re there, the more cost-efficient your care becomes. This means you can get more hours of quality help without unnecessary financial pressure. We keep it fair, flexible, and clearly explained from the start.
- 6. Personal Attention for Every Family
							
						
						
						
							We start by listening—because no two families are the same. Every care plan we create is built around your needs, your concerns, and your loved one’s preferences. It’s never just a template—it’s a partnership.
- 7. Responsive to Sudden Changes in Need
							
						
						
						
							Life doesn’t always follow a schedule, and neither do care needs. We’re available to adjust your support quickly—whether that means same-day service, increased care hours, or short-term relief during a busy time. You’ll always be met with flexibility and understanding.
- 9. We Believe in Dignity-First Support
							
						
						
						
							Whether we’re helping with meals, hygiene, or mobility, we treat each client with respect and patience. We know that asking for help can be difficult, so we offer assistance in a way that supports confidence and self-worth.
- 10. We Strengthen Your Role, Not Replace It
							
						
						
						
							Our goal is to support—not take over—your relationship with your loved one. With our home care services, you can return to being a son, daughter, or spouse, while we help with the physical care and routines that may be more difficult to manage alone.
- 11. Experienced, Dedicated Caregivers
							
						
						
						
							We hire people who are passionate about what they do and train them thoroughly. Many of our caregivers have long-standing relationships with clients and continue to serve with kindness, attentiveness, and strong communication.

- 13. We Cover a Wide Range of Needs
							
						
						
						
							Our services aren’t limited to one kind of support. From short visits to full-day home care services, we’re equipped to assist with everything from mobility to meal prep to companionship. You don’t need multiple providers—we handle it all.
- 14. We’re Focused on Long-Term Trust
							
						
						
						
							We don’t aim to provide quick fixes—we want to build lasting relationships. Families often stay with us for years because they know they can rely on us through each stage of their care journey. That kind of consistency matters.
- 15. We’re Rooted in the Local Community
							
						
						
						
							We’ve been serving Doylestown and the surrounding area for over two decades. We’re proud to be part of the local fabric and committed to helping our neighbors age in place with dignity, comfort, and meaningful care.

- 1. Licensed Nurses Who Focus on You
							
						
						
						
							Every nurse on our team is licensed and trained to provide medical care in a home setting. We don’t send general caregivers for clinical tasks—only qualified professionals. That means your loved one gets safe, informed support every step of the way.
- 2. Personalized Plans, Not Prewritten Protocols
							
						
						
						
							No two patients are alike. We create nursing plans tailored to individual diagnoses, preferences, and goals. You’ll never receive one-size-fits-all care—everything we do is built around your specific needs.
- 3. Care That Comes to You—No Facility Required
							
						
						
						
							Our in-home nursing care allows clients to remain in their most comfortable setting: their home. There’s no need for stressful commutes, crowded waiting rooms, or disruptive facility visits. We bring quality care directly to your door.
- 4. Support for Chronic Conditions at Home
							
						
						
						
							We provide specialized chronic illness home care for clients managing long-term health concerns. From diabetes and heart disease to mobility and respiratory challenges, our nurses offer structured, compassionate care that promotes daily stability.
- 5. Consistent Monitoring That Prevents Emergencies
							
						
						
						
							Our nurses track changes in health status, ensuring that early signs of concern are caught and addressed quickly. This kind of attention reduces unnecessary hospital visits and keeps care proactive, not reactive.
- 7. Post-Surgical Care That Aids Recovery
							
						
						
						
							After surgery, it’s essential to have consistent medical oversight during recovery. Our private in-home nurse team supports wound care, mobility, and overall recovery in a safe and familiar setting.
- 8. Education for Patients and Families
							
						
						
						
							We don’t just treat—we teach. Our nurses help clients and families understand diagnoses, equipment, and care plans. This empowers you to stay informed and take part in your care journey confidently.
- 9. No Insurance Delays or Approval Hassles
							
						
						
						
							Because our services are privately paid, you’re not limited by insurance networks or delays. You get the care you want, when you want it—without unnecessary red tape or approval wait times.
- 10. Relief for Family Caregivers
							
						
						
						
							Caring for a loved one on your own can become physically and emotionally exhausting. Our private duty nurses lighten that load by handling the clinical side of care, so you can focus on being a spouse, child, or partner again.
- 11. Flexible Hours—From Hourly to 24/7 Care
							
						
						
						
							We don’t force care into fixed blocks. Whether you need help for an hour, overnight, or full-time, we offer scheduling that fits your life. We even provide 24 hour caregiver services when around-the-clock nursing is necessary.

							Many of our nurses have provided care for their own loved ones and bring that same sense of dedication to your home. They know how to communicate with respect, encourage independence, and meet clients where they are.

							We work closely with other providers—whether you’re using physical therapy, home care aides, or mobility services. Our nursing staff ensures that care is well-rounded, consistent, and easy to manage for families.
- Skilled Nursing Care That Puts You in Control
- Let’s Build a Care Plan That Works for Your Family
- 1. Therapy Tailored to the Individual, Not the Diagnosis
							
						
						
						
							We understand that every person’s needs are different—even if their diagnosis is the same. Our therapists create therapy plans based on how you move, think, and live each day. This personalized approach ensures therapy is effective, meaningful, and achievable.
- 2. In-Home Therapy That Supports Daily Life
							
						
						
						
							Our occupational therapy services help clients master the small tasks that make up everyday routines. From dressing to preparing meals, we focus on restoring confidence and safety at home. This kind of functional care makes recovery feel more relevant and rewarding.
- 3. Strength Building That Supports Long-Term Mobility
							
						
						
						
							We don’t just help you feel better in the moment—we work to strengthen the muscles and joints that support long-term stability. Through physical therapy services, we promote safe movement, improved endurance, and overall health.
- 6. We Make Therapy Convenient for Families
							
						
						
						
							By bringing home rehabilitation services to you, we remove the burden of driving to and from appointments. Families no longer have to juggle work, traffic, and mobility challenges just to access care. It’s one less thing to worry about.
- 7. Support After Surgery or Hospitalization
							
						
						
						
							After a hospital stay, mobility and confidence can feel limited. Our therapists work directly with post-operative clients to restore strength and ability at their pace, in their space. This support can reduce the risk of re-injury or readmission.
- 8. Therapy That Respects the Client’s Pace
							
						
						
						
							We never rush sessions or push too hard. Our therapists meet each client where they are physically and emotionally, helping them progress without pressure. It’s care that supports both safety and motivation.

							Occupational therapy services aren’t just about exercise—they’re about enabling you to do what matters most. Whether it’s gardening, cooking, or writing, we help you regain the ability to engage in what makes life meaningful.
- 11. Private, Focused Care Without Distractions
							
						
						
						
							Unlike busy clinics, in-home sessions are free from noise, long wait times, and distractions. Clients receive full attention from their therapist, allowing for more effective and focused care.
- 12. Family Involvement Is Always Welcome
							
						
						
						
							We encourage family members to observe or participate in therapy when appropriate. This helps caregivers understand how to assist between sessions and creates a team-based approach to healing and progress.
- 13. Therapists Who Teach, Not Just Treat
							
						
						
						
							Our therapists are not just there to guide exercises—they educate clients and families on body mechanics, safety, and strategies for long-term wellness. That knowledge becomes a lasting tool for independence and self-care.
- 14. Flexible Scheduling That Works for You
							
						
						
						
							We offer therapy sessions when they work best for your routine—whether it’s morning, afternoon, or early evening. We know how valuable your time is, and we shape our services to respect it.

- Why should I choose Living Care Home Services?
							
						
						
						
							There are lots of reasons to choose us! We use only the best caregivers who are available. We are family owned with family values who understand family needs. We show up, you can depend on us. We are totally dedicated to providing compassionate, reliable, and affordable care. We have experience, not just as professionally trained caregivers but as members of families who needed to provide care for our own families. We really care and we understand your unique situation because we have been there ourselves. “We Take the Worry Out of Caring for Someone You Love.”
- What’s the difference between Living Care and other companies?
							
						
						
						
							Living Care Home Services was started by Sean Lynch from his home in 2001. He was the first and only caregiver employed at the company for the first year. He worked day, middle and overnight shifts, personally escorted a client to Minnesota for a week to have a transplant check-up, worked with Hospice clients and was there holding their hand when they passed, and has worked with both male and female clients that first year. He has also had members of his own family receive home care services so understands the frustrations and the joy families can experience when getting outside help. This background helps meet client needs and better support the caregivers who are part of the household and those from our company.
- I need help now…can you help me?
							
						
						
						
							Absolutely. We are committed to every hour of care a family may require. Our team is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We have a live answering service that can direct you to the right person to meet your needs after office hours. The service has been a part of our team for many years and understands your needs and will direct you accordingly. They will also listen to you, and make sure you get the help you need. We are committed to filling your needs within 24 hours or even the same day. We will do our best and we’ll respect you and be honest with you if we can’t meet your requirements.
- Do you provide care to clients in assisted living or other types of facilities?
							
						
						
						
							Yes. Our caregivers have provided care to family members in many local facilities such as assisted living, nursing homes, hospitals, etc. All facilities are required to obtain caregiver information such as certification and TB testing. All our caregivers are current with these requirements which enhance our ability to respond to requests within facilities. Most of the local facilities recognize our diligence in meeting their requirements and work well with us in meeting your needs in their facility.
- How much does care cost?
							
						
						
						
							The cost of obtaining care depends upon the type of care you require. We have very affordable HOURLY rates which vary depending on the amount of time we spend with you. The longer we are with you, the less expensive your hourly rate will be. The rates are the same for weekday, weekend, and overnight hours. We also provide 24-hour Live-in care with a DAILY rate associated with that level of care. To obtain specific costs, please get in touch with us.
- What if my situation changes and I need to change the service I receive?
							
						
						
						
							We are flexible. We want to meet your needs and often those needs will change over time. We change with you. When you need a little more or a lot more help, we’ll be there. When you need less care, we’ll be there then too. You’re never locked onto services. As your needs change, we’ll change to accommodate you.
- Do you provide hospice care?
							
						
						
						
							Yes. We are very proud of our non-medical hospice care services. We have individual caregivers with specific training in this area and only take hospice cases. These caregivers are special people who understand the hospice process and feel that it is their “calling” to help families navigate through this beautiful period of their life. This is a special time in someone’s life and the right caregiver can make all the difference in helping the individual and the family feel safe, well cared for, and understood.
